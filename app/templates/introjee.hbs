            {{paper-icon "toggle_off" size=48}}{{paper-icon "delete_forever" size=48}} Choice: Even if there was a choice in the questions, the questions usually involve a combination of concepts, will not be easy to drop some parts.

            <img src="jeronimo-dice-11.svg" width="50">{{paper-icon "delete_forever" size=48}} Multiple choice questions have only one correct answer and also some have many correct answers. For example, consider this question in JEE Advanced 2018 Paper 1, Question 2, Mathematics.
            The question gives some information about a triangle PQR, the angle PQR and the lengths of PQ and QR. Now four statements are given and the candidate is supposed to choose <b>ALL</b> the TRUE statements for full marks or there is a partial marking or negative marking possibilities depending on the kind of answers.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>First option is about the value of angle QPR</li>
            <li>Second option is about  the values of area of triange and angle QRP</li>
            <li>Third option is about  the value of radius of incircle of the triangle</li>
            <li>Fourth option is about the value of area of the circumcircle of the triangle</li>
          </ul>

            <p>
              {{paper-icon "translate" size=48}}{{paper-icon "compare_arrows" size=48}} English to Equation translation is not usually single step. If we look at the above question on triangle, the english to equation translation is not a single step. There are intermediary steps that need to be negotiated before the desired value can be found
